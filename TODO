TODO:
* Add try/except handlers where needed
* Add channel-panel validation and self-rectify routine
- test cases for scene add/remove/change
- refine UI layouts, update screenshots and readme

ISSUES:
** light list, filter types not populated upon activation
 - check lightdesk.init flag in PT_lights draw OR set a 2s timer in load_post to set init flase and trigger get_lights in draw
* light list not refreshed upon object add/remove
* light list not refreshed upon scene change? test this

IDEAS:
? set a lightdesk property to track the active scene object with a msgbus callback
    which triggers a check for object type is LIGHT or None to call collate_scene_lights
    when objects are added/deleted in the scene
? channel panel class bl_option = {'INSTANCED'} for modifier style sub-panel
